# Flask Study

Creating REST API's with Flask framework.

First, you need to install the requirements of the project. I'm using Python version 3.7. Feel free to create a enviroment to encapsulate the project.

```[python]
$: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After, run the project:
```[python]
$: python app.py
```
